Description of data:
	This dataset includes the full island nation of Singapore as well as neighboring areas in Malaysia and surrounding Indonesian islands.

Reason for using this data:

	I chose this data as I've lived in Singapore for some time and many of the real-world locations referenced in the data were known to me.  This would help me to understand how the data related to these real-world locations.  Additionally, Singapore is a country with four official languages.  As such, there would likely be some interesting issues related to character sets and abbreviation standards.
